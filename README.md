#Pandas_Challenge

**Overview**
Analyze district-wide standardized test results. Based on math scores, reading scores, and various school data I will aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

**Results**

-Overall district analysis-
*Out of all 15 schools there is definitely room for improvement regarding math scores. On average the reading scores were good. The numbers for math, or lack thereof, definitely pulled the percent passing rate for both subjects down substantially. 


-School Summary Analysis-
*Unsurprisingly the schools with smaller student populations scored much better overall passing rates than their larger counterparts. 
*Overall, district type schools scored much worse than their charter counterparts. 
*Also not surprising, the per student budget had a negative correlation relative to total students in attendance, i.e. the more students, the less per student budget. 


-Top Performing Schools-
*It should come as no surprise that the top five performing schools were all charter schools with higher per student budgets, smaller student populations, and, on average, higher school budgets.


-Bottom Performing Schools-
*All district schools, all just about 3k+ students each. Interestingly enough, two of these five schools had per student budgets that were equivalent to the top performing schools. Perhaps some misuse of school money amongst the admin? Speculation, speculation. 


-Math Scores by Grade-
*Much to my surprise the scores all stayed relatively consistent from freshman to senior year for all schools. I assumed senioritis would have a more detrimental effect on the latter portion of the high school tenure. 


-Reading Scores by Grade-
*Reading scores mirrored the math scores. They all stayed relatively consistent from freshman year to senior year. 


-Scores by School Spending-
*The more money you throw into the school spending did not yield the best results. The $630-$645 range yielded the best results, by a large margin.


-Scores by School Size-
*As mentioned earlier the smaller the school size the better the overall passing rate, math, and reading scores. Basically, every school with less than 2000 students was set up for more success than their 2000+ counterparts. Whatâ€™s really interesting is how 2000 students seems to be the breaking point. 


-Scores by School Type-
*No surprise here, the charter schools outperformed the district schools handily.
